DESCRIPTION
-----------

This module provides a Perl interface to the PAM library.


PREREQUISITES
-------------

Before you can build Authen::PAM you need to have the following
thing installed on your system:

    * Perl, version 5
    * PAM library (either Linux-PAM or Solaris PAM library)

  The Linux-PAM home page is http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam


BUILDING AND INSTALLING THE MODULE
----------------------------------

Assuming you have met all the prerequisites, building the module should
be relatively straightforward.

First if you are using a version of the PAM older then 0.54 (without the
functions for manipulating the environment) you must edit the file PAM.xs 
and comment the line defining PAM_HAVE_ENV_FUNCTIONS. (If you know an 
automatic way to determine this situation I will be glad to hear it.)

Then the module can now be built using this sequence of commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If you have problems in the first step the you probably don't have a PAM 
library installed on your system.

The 'make' command can fail if there is some incompatibility between the 
version of PAM which you are using and the current implementation of this
module. In this case please write me a mail with the problems you see,
the versions of PAM, Perl, Linux, glibc which you are using and eventualy
all header files found in your /usr/include/security directory and I will
try to fix it.


KNOWN PROBLEMS
--------------

If you are using RedHat 5.0 distribution then you should upgrade your 
glibc package because it has a bug in the dlopen function. I tested it
with version 2.0.7-6 and it works ok.


If you are using perl, version 5.004_03 then you will probably see the
following error during the compilation of PAM.xs file to PAM.c:

   PAM.c:NNN: invalid format `#line' directive.

This is caused by a bug in the xsubpp compiler.
The simpliest way to solve this problem is to open the file PAM.c,
delete the line with the error and run make again.

The other solution is to patch your xsubpp compiler. Go to your perl
directory (usually /usr/lib/perl5 or /usr/local/lib/perl5) and apply the
patch xsubpp-1.9504.patch.
