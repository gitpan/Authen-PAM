DESCRIPTION
===========

This module provides a Perl interface to the PAM library.


PREREQUISITES
=============

Before you can build Authen::PAM you need to have the following
things installed on your system:

  * Perl, at least version 5.003_23
  * This module is known to work with the following implementations of 
    the PAM library:
    - Linux-PAM
    - Solaris 2.6
    - FreeBSD 3.1

  The Linux-PAM home page is http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/


BUILDING AND INSTALLING THE MODULE
==================================

Assuming you have met all the prerequisites, you can built the module 
using the following sequence of commands:

    ./configure
    make
    make test
    make install

If the name of your perl executable is different than `perl' and/or
it is not located in your $PATH then use the following:

    PERL=/path_to_perl/perl_name ./configure


If you have any problems in building and installing the module then you
should first check on the home page of the Authen::PAM module at address
http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/~pelov/pam/ for the latest development version
(if any) which could possibly fix your problems. If none is avaliable or the
problems remain then you can write me a mail which includes the following
information:
  * the version of your unix `uname -a'
  * the version of the perl `perl -V'
  * if you are on linux:
    - which distribution you are using
    - the the version of the pam `ls /lib/libpam*' or `ls /usr/lib/libpam*'
  * the description of the "login" service from your pam configuration
    usually found in `/etc/pam.conf' file or in the file `/etc/pam.d/login'
  * the output of the `./configure', `make' and `make test'


KNOWN PROBLEMS
==============

  Buggy glibc2
  ------------

  Some of the first versions of the glibc2 libraries have a bug in the
  dlopen function which will prevent this module from working. If you are 
  using an original RedHat 5.0 distribution then you probably have this 
  problem. 
  I know that the bug is fixed in at least version 2.0.7-6 of the glibc2 
  library. 


  Perl version 5.004_03
  ---------------------

  If you are using perl, version 5.004_03 then you will probably see the
  following error during the compilation of PAM.xs file to PAM.c:

     PAM.c:NNN: invalid format `#line' directive.

  This is caused by a bug in the perl xsubpp compiler.
  The simpliest way to solve this problem is to open the file PAM.c,
  delete the line with the error and run make again.

  The other solution is to patch your xsubpp compiler. Go to your perl
  directory (usually /usr/lib/perl5 or /usr/local/lib/perl5) and apply the
  patch xsubpp-1.9504.patch.
