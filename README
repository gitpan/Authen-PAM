DESCRIPTION
===========

This module provides a Perl interface to the PAM library.


PREREQUISITES
=============

Before you can build Authen::PAM you need to have the following
things installed on your system:

  * Perl, at least version 5.003_23
  * This module is known to work with the following or newer 
    implementations of the PAM library:
    - Linux-PAM
    - Solaris 2.6
    - FreeBSD 3.1

  The Linux-PAM home page is http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/


BUILDING AND INSTALLING THE MODULE
==================================

Assuming you have met all the prerequisites, you can built the module 
using the following sequence of commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If you have any problems in building and installing the module then you
should first check on the home page of the Authen::PAM module at address
http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/~pelov/pam/ for the latest development version
(if any) which could possibly fix your problems. If none is avaliable or the
problems remain then you can write me a mail which includes the following
information:
  * the version of your unix - `uname -a'
  * the version of the perl - `perl -V'
  * if you are on linux:
    - the name and version of the distribution you are using
    - the the version of the pam - `ls /lib/libpam*' or `ls /usr/lib/libpam*'
  * the description of the "login" service from your pam configuration -
    usually found in `/etc/pam.conf' file or in the file `/etc/pam.d/login'
  * the output of the `perl Makefile.PL', `make' and `make test'
  * any relevant messages produced by the syslogd daemon -
    usually found in `/var/log/messages'


KNOWN PROBLEMS
==============

  Buggy glibc2
  ------------

  Some of the first versions of the glibc2 libraries have a bug in the
  dlopen function which will prevent this module from working. If you are
  using an original RedHat 5.0 distribution then you probably have this
  problem.
  I know that the bug is fixed in at least version 2.0.7-6 of the glibc2
  library.

  Bug in the Solaris 2.6 PAM library
  ----------------------------------

  There is a known bug in the Solaris 2.6 PAM library for which I have
  implemented a workaround. This bug is fixed in Solaris 2.7.
  The name and the version of your OS is determined by looking at the
  variables 'osname' and 'osvers' from the perl 'Config' module and if they 
  match 'solaris' and '2.6' then the workaround is activated. 
  To see the values of this variables you can use `perl -V:osname -V:osvers'.

  If you are building this module on a different version of Solaris (e.g 2.7)
  and you are planning to use it on Solaris 2.6 or if you are working on
  Solaris 2.6 and your perl is build on a different version of Solaris
  (and hence the value of 'osvers' is not '2.6') then you must activate the 
  workaround manually by running

     perl Makefile.PL -DSTATIC_CONV_FUNC


  Perl version 5.004_03
  ---------------------

  If you are using perl, version 5.004_03 then you will probably see the
  following error during the compilation of PAM.xs file to PAM.c:

     PAM.c:NNN: invalid format `#line' directive.

  This is caused by a bug in the perl xsubpp compiler.
  The simpliest way to solve this problem is to open the file PAM.c,
  delete the line with the error and run make again.

  The other solution is to patch your xsubpp compiler. Go to your perl
  directory (usually /usr/lib/perl5 or /usr/local/lib/perl5) and apply the
  patch xsubpp-1.9504.patch.
