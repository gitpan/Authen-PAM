Revision history for Perl extension Authen::PAM.

0.06  1999-May-19
	- the test script now passes to pam the current tty which is needed
	  by some authentication modules (e.g. pam_securetty)
	- some of the test programs in configure need to be linked with -ldl
	  under Linux

	  turn off the echo (thanks to Charlie Brady <charlieb@aurema.com>)

0.05  1999-Mar-23
	- the package is now configured with a `configure' script
	- the module can now be used with FreeBSD 3.1 PAM library
	  (thanks to Adrian Pavlykevych <pam@polynet.lviv.ua>)
