Revision history for Perl extension Authen::PAM.

0.11  2000-Dec-06
	- reorganized the PAM.xs for easier support of callback functions
	- added support for user (perl) defined fail_delay function
	- the pam_fail_delay function was not exported
	- fixed a bug when calling pam_set_item($pamh, PAM_CONV_FUNC, ...)
	- the PAM.xs now compiles on perl 5.6 (thanks to Roland Pope 
	  <rpope@jade.co.nz>) 
 	- the compiler can be changed by setting the environment variable
	  CC before calling 'perl Makefile.PL'

0.10  2000-May-02
	- fixed some small problems with the constructor 'new'
	  (thanks to <wil@langford.net>)
	- added a FAQ file

	  new versions of the Linux PAM library

0.09  2000-Feb-03
	- fixed a bug in PAM.xs when more than one messages are given
	  to the conversation function (thanks to Oleg Bulavsky 
	  <bulch@sibnet.ru>)
	- small changes to the test script
	- several old constant symbols are exported only on request;
	  also created two tags :constants and :functions for easier
 	  exporting only some of the symbols

0.08  1999-Sep-13
	- fixed a bug when returning empty strings from the conversation 
	  function (thanks to Eric Einhorn <outcast@shell.monmouth.com>))

0.07  1999-Jun-08
	- the test script now gets the user name from the real user id
	- restored back the file Makefile.PL and modified the configuration 
	  process so that the module is now build in the standard way
	- added a dummy file d/PAM.pm so that CPAN can find the version
	  number and the docs (thanks to Graham Barr <gbarr@pobox.com>)

0.06  1999-May-19
	- the test script now passes to pam the current tty which is needed
	  by some authentication modules (e.g. pam_securetty)
	- some of the test programs in configure need to be linked with -ldl
	  under Linux
	- the default converstation function now uses termios functions to
	  turn off the echo (thanks to Charlie Brady <charlieb@aurema.com>)

0.05  1999-Mar-23
	- the package is now configured with a `configure' script
	- the module can now be used with FreeBSD 3.1 PAM library
	  (thanks to Adrian Pavlykevych <pam@polynet.lviv.ua>)
	- removed the PAM_AUTHTOK and PAM_OLDAUTHTOK constants because they
	  can be used only by modules
	- the test script now returns the pam error code for tests which fail

0.04  1998-Oct-30
	- in the previous version the HAVE_PAM_ENV_FUNCTIONS was incorrectly
